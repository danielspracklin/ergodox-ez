# ergodox-ez
My ErgoDox EZ layout

This is the layout I've chosen for my ErgoDoz EZ Glow.

Major changes so far:

- I mapped directional arrows to ijkl on L2
- I mapped Oryx to the printed apostrophe key for Live Training (might switch that once I'm more comfortable typing on this board)
- I mapped quotation marks to L1 on the apostrophe key just above right shift; still thinking about this one as it's a bit awkward, but I don't type quotes that often
- I changed the `meh` tap to the pipe (` %>%`) for easier `dplyr` manipulability
- I moved delete to the right thumb cluster so that it is opposite backspace. Now tab is in the "usual" spot
- I switched the "usual" caps lock key to escape
- I turned auto shift on!
- I mapped some of the 1.5u keys to stuff I use frequently in R (`+`, `=`)
