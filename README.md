My ErgoDox EZ layout

This is the layout I've chosen for my ErgoDoz EZ Glow.

Major changes so far:

- I switched to Colemak in May 2020 and have mapped L1 to Colemak accordingly. I've kept
L0 on QWERTY for now, but may make the switch later on.
- I moved escape to QWERTY's caps lock (and Colemak's backspace).
- Thumb clusters handle (from left to right) space, backspace, delete and enter. Holding space and enter give control and alt, respectively.
- I enabled auto-shift; still need to tweak the trigger length.
- I've really come to appreciate space-cadet shifts, which now have me desperately mashing shift when on a non-QMK board
- I added an extend layer inspired by [DreymaR's layout](https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2014-extend-extra-extreme/) but with reordered shift, control and alt. Easier on my brain!
